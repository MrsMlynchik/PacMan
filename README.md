Make sure Pacman.java, GameWindow.java and all images are imported and is present in the same folder.
Run the GameWindow which calls the Pacman class.
Main features to test : pacman movement, ghost movement, score implementation by eating foods and cherries(only in Maze 3), teleport portals, implementation of lives and implementation of levels.
Game flow: Start screen -> Level select -> Maze select -> Play game -> LOSE: game resets automatically to the same choices || WIN: returns back to the Level select.
NOTE: Maze 4 - is a test maze intended to test the winning case easily hence some features are ommited.
